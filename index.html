  <p>It is a chassis with electronics that mounts on Tamiya double gearbox 70168. The electronics provides two DC motor drivers, eight pieces infrared
  sensors for line tracking, two rotation encoders to monitor wheel speed.</p>
  <p>The design aims at easy construction and versatility with extension. There are mounting holes for Arduino R3 and gyroscope. There are sockets for
  communication modules. There is provision for servo motor and ultrasound object detector. It works on 5 volt as well as 3.3 volt to serve most MCU on market.
  With an optional on-board 5 volt DC/DC converter, it can run on Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
  <p>It is not limited to a robot car. By mounting battery above the wheels, it becomes a balancing robot.</p>
  <p>It differs to low end competitors in its durable Tamiya gearbox which allows simple replacement of DC motor.</p>
  <p>Its palm-size makes it suitable for students to bring along and storage at school.</p>
